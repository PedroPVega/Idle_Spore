An online game that simulates the EA Game Spore, as a clicking simulator, idle game

## Description of the project
This project was made using React, an open source Js library that allows dynamic web design.
It is an ongoing project that started the 27 of june 2025.
It was entirely made by myself, besides the ideas taken from Spore, a game entirely owned by EA.

## TODO-list
- try to delete the node_modules at the root of the project and check that it still works

## Legal mentions
This is by all means intended to be an open source project. But it isn't intended to be a paying game.
