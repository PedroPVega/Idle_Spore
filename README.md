# Idle_Spore
An online game that simulates the EA Game Spore, as a clicking simulator, idle game

## Description of the project
This project was made using React, an open source Js library that allows dynamic web design.
It is an ongoing project that started the 27 of june 2025.
It was entirely made by myself, besides the ideas taken from Spore, a game entirely owned by EA.

## TODO-list
- erase the package.json and package-lock.json files from the root of the project
- redefine upper and lower nav bars
- add a little image to the mainscreen and add buttons to launch the game

## Legal mentions
This is by all means intended to be an open source project. But it isn't intended to be a paying game.
If you stumbled upon this project after paying a third party, please do take legal action lol.
